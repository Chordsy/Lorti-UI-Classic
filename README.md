# Lorti UI Classic

Updated for Classic WoW

Still a work in progress!

If you find any bugs add me on discord, Chordsy#8773 or add a new "Issue" here on Github.

If the addon is not loading, make sure you have removed any dashes in the name and also remove the "-master" part that gets added to the name after downloading it. 

It should look like this "Interface\AddOns\Lorti UI Classic"
