# Lorti UI Classic.

Darkens the default UI.

Big thanks to the original creator of this UI, Lorti. This is simply updated to work with the Classic client and does not work with any other vanilla/private server client.

>**IMPORTANT INFO REGARDING MISSING Target-of-Target FRAME**

I'm looking into the Target of Target frame that seems to crash for some users. Not exactly sure what's causing it but a temporary fix might be to remove everything on Line 120-139 in the \Lorti-UI-Classic\core\auras.lua file.
This will make the buff/debuff frame of your target revert to "Standard UI" looks. 

**Let me know if it works!**

Remove the "-master" when downloaded. Folder should look like this: \Interface\AddOns\Lorti-UI-Classic
