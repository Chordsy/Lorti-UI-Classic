# Lorti UI Classic. 

**IMPORTANT** 
Always make sure you have the latest version. The beta is constantly updated and i try to fix things ASAP.
UI elements might be changed from the beta/stresstest to the actual release. So you might get LUA errors.


Some parts of the UI might not be colored correctly because of: 

- A bug in my code 
- I havent gotten around to it yet
- I dont know how to do it.


Updated for Classic WoW. This addon DOES NOT work on vanilla private servers.

Still a work in progress! 

If you find any bugs add me on discord, Chordsy#8773 or add a new "Issue" here on Github. Screenshots of your issues are VERY appreciated!

Only remove the "-master" after the folder name. Leave the other dashes.
